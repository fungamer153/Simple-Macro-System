# Simple-Macro-System
Devoted by pure hatred of paywall applications, I set out of journey to provide all of us simpletons with a free macro.

# Usage
There are 2 files, you can either download the .exe and run it straight of there or use the python provided code.
When entering values press space to register the new values, I do not know the keybinds possible but things like F5 are possible to go figure.

(Exe is inside dist folder btw)

USE 0 WAIT TIMER AT YOUR OWN RISK!
